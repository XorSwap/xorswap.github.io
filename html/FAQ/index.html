<h1>FAQ</h1>
<b>What does FAQ stand for?</b><br/>
Frequently Asked Questions.<br/>
<b>Why does the website have such a strange name?</b><br/>
The name of the website is simply it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">ip address</a>, It has no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>.
(like www.google.com)  This is mainly because I am too cheap to actually pay for it.  You can use
<a href="http://__.port0.org/">__.port0.org</a>, but I refer to the website as 142.161.61.68.<br/>
<b>Who are you?</b><br/>
<a href="http://xkcd.com/about/">I'm just this guy, you know?</a>
I try to remain anonymous online, because I want to.  (e.g. searching my name in quotes gives no results)
The Email for this website is <a href='m&#97;il&#116;o&#58;%6&#68;ail%2E142&#46;1%361&#46;&#37;36&#49;&#46;68&#64;gm&#97;&#37;69l&#46;com'>mai&#108;&#46;1&#52;2&#46;161&#46;&#54;1&#46;6&#56;&#64;g&#109;ail&#46;com</a>.
If I'm on a website, I usually stick to the username XorSwap.<br/>
<b>Describe yourself in six words or less.</b><br/>
No.<br/>
<b>What's your favorite programming language?</b><br/>
C.<br/>
<b>Why?</b><br/>
Loads of other languages are written in C.<br/>
<b>What's your favorite color?</b><br/>
Really?  Look at the entire website!<br/>
<b>What's your favorite poem?</b><br/>
It's a tie between <i>The Jabberwocky</i> and <i>The Black Perl</i>.<br/>
<h2>Questions about the server (now out of date)</h2>
<b>What hosting service do you use?</b><br/>
Pfft...  Hosting! Ha!<br/>
The server is a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>
running Apache on Raspbian Linux.  
I usually only have a power and ethernet cable attached to it, and use 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> 
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>
 onto it and develop the website from there.  I also use <a href="http://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>
I keep the server behind my TV cabnet when it is running, because that's the
 only way the cables reach.
When running, the Pi stays in a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lego-Raspberry-Pi-Case/">Lego case</a>
 that keeps it cool and protects it from blunt force trauma.<br/>
<b>What do you use to make the webpages?</b><br/>
I use <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">GNU Nano</a> and the WinSCP default editor, mostly.
Since the Pi is, well, just a Pi, I upload all images to imgur, and just reference them from there.
(My imgur account is <a href="http://1421616168.imgur.com/">1421616168.imgur.com</a>)<br/>
<b>May I see the server?</b><br/>
Yes.<br/>
