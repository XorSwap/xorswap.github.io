Main Principles:
	Unusual
	FSM
	A little creepy
	Exploratory
	No ending
	Message: no matter what happens within a game, you will always be able to reset it.  There is no permanence.
	Create odd things, let others prescribe them meaning, point it out to them.
	Not everything has meaning.
	Lots of visual puns.
