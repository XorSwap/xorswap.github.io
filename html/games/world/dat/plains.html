There is a massive wall of rock, towering up<br/>into the sky as far as the eye can see.  Set into the rock at a slight<br/>angle are two perfectly rectangular, pale white, doors.  There are<br/>flat notches set into the cliff every foot, forming a ladder leading to a<br/>hole in the wall about 10 meters up.<br/><a href="plains_doors.html">Doors</a> <a href="plains_ladder.html">Ladder</a> <a href="plains_field.html">Field</a> </pre></center></body></html>
