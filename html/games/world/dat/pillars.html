Aside for a few gaps here and there, they<br/>almost completely fill the area.  You seem to be standing in a clearing,<br/>surrounded by the pillars.  The sky is black here, and you can see that<br/>the pillars are glowing slightly.  There is no sign of the trapdoor<br/>that led you here.<br/><a href="pillars_dynamo_gap.html">Gap</a> <a href="pillars_suit_gap.html">Gap</a> <a href="pillars_out_gap.html">Gap</a> </pre></center></body></html>
