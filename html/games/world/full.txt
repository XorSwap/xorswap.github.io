|There is a guard in one of the towers.

$~ $ CAT POEM.TXT
|ONCE UPON A MIDNIGHT DREARY,
|FINGERS CRAMPED AND VISION BLEARY,
|    SYSTEM MANUALS PILED HIGH
|    AND WASTED PAPER ON THE FLOOR,
|LONGING FOR THE WARMTH OF BEDSHEETS,
|STILL I SAT HERE DOING SPREADSHEETS:
|HAVING REACHED THE BOTTOM LINE,
|I TOOK A FLOPPY FROM THE DRAWER.
|
|TYPING WITH A STEADY HAND,
|I THEN INVOKED THE "SAVE" COMMAND
|    BUT GOT INSTEAD A REPRIMAND:
|    IT READ, "ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE?"
|WAS THIS SOME OCCULT ILLUSION?
|SOME MANIACAL TYPE INTRUSION?
|THESE WERE CHOICES SOLOMON HIMSELF,
|HAD NEVER FACED BEFORE.
|
|CAREFULLY I WEIGHED MY OPTIONS...
|THESE THREE SEEMED TO BE THE TOP ONES.
|    CLEARLY I MUST NOW ADOPT ONE;
|    CHOOSE: ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE?
|WITH MY FINGERS PALE AND TREMBLING
|SLOWLY TOWARD THE KEYBOARD BENDING,
|LONGING FOR A HAPPY ENDING,
|HOPING ALL WOULD BE RESTORED
|
|PRAYING FOR SOME GUARANTEE,
|FINALLY I PRESSED A KEY.
|BUT WHAT ON THE SCREEN DID I SEE?
|    AGAIN "ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE?"
|    I TRIED TO CATCH THE CHIPS OFF GUARD -
|I PRESSED AGAIN, BUT TWICE AS HARD,
|BUT LUCK WAS JUST NOT ON THE CARDS,
|I SAW WHAT I HAD SEEN BEFORE.
|
|NOW I TYPED IN DESPERATION
|TRYING RANDOM COMBINATIONS.
|    STILL THERE CAME THE INCANTATION
|    "ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE."
|THERE I SAT, DISTRAUGHT, EXHAUSTED,
|BY MY OWN MACHINE ACCOSTED
|GETTING UP, I TURNED AWAY
|AND PACED ACROSS THE OFFICE FLOOR.
|
|AND THEN I SAW AN AWFUL SIGHT
|A BOLD AND BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT
|A LIGHTENING BOLT THAT CUT THE NIGHT,
|    AND SHOOK ME TO MY VERY CORE.
|    THE PC SCREEN COLLAPSED AND DIED.
|"OH NO! MY DATABASE!" I CRIED.
|I HEARD A DISTANT VOICE REPLY,
|"YOU'LL SEE YOUR SPREADSHEETS NEVERMORE!"
|
|TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW
|THE PLACE TO WHICH OUR DATA GOES.
|    PERHAPS IT GOES TO HEAVEN,
|    WHERE THE ANGELS HAVE IT STORED.
|BUT AS FOR PRODUCTIVITY, WELL,
|I FEAR THIS HAS GONE STRAIGHT TO HELL.
|AND THAT'S THE TALE I HAVE TO TELL -
