$Plains
|You are standing in the middle of a field of golden coloured wheat.  It
|sways a bit in the wind.  There is a massive wall of rock, towering up
|into the sky as far as the eye can see.  Set into the rock at a slight
|angle are two perfectly rectangular, pale white, doors.  There are
|flat notches set into the cliff every foot, forming a ladder leading to a
|hole in the wall about 10 meters up.
