$West City Gate
|A mossy stone wall stretches as far as the eye can see in both
|directions, curving gently away from you.  Set into the wall is an iron
|gate, flanked on both sides by round stone towers set into the wall. 
|There is a guard in one of the towers.

|This place doesn't really look much like a city; it's more like a small
|village than anything.  The buildings are all made of wood and the same
|stone brick as the walls to the city.  The ground is covered in a fine,
|reddish brown dust.
|
|You can see the city's gate from here.
