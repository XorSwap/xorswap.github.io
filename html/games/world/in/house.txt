$The Beginning
|Blackness surrounds you.  You feel a sharp jolt as you wake up.

$Your Bedroom
|It's a mess.  There are dirty cloths and pieces of paper all
|over the floor.  You really need to clean this mess up sometime.
|This is mainly because your mother keeps telling you to,
|though, not because you think it's a good idea.

$Hallway
|The hallway is very neat.  A gorgeous patterned rug lies on the
|hardwood floor.

$Not Your Bedroom
|This is your parent's bedroom, and it's way neater
|than yours.  The bed is made, and there are two nightstands
|on either side of it.  A large wooden dresser takes up most of a wall.

$Bathroom
|The bathroom has a black and white tiled floor.  A toilet,
|a sink, a shower, and a closet are all packed into the small space.

|You are in a largeish, round room.  There is a TV on one wall, and a
|round couch along the opposite one.  The room is painted a shade of
|dark green.

$Living Room
|You are in a largeish, round room.  There is a TV on one wall, and a
|round couch along the opposite one.  The room is painted a shade of
|dark green.  You can't quite put your finger on it, but something feels
|different.  Is it colder?

$TV
|The TV shows one image: a white circle on a black background, with a
|gap at the top.  A vertical line goes through the gap.

$Hallway?
|The doorway opens onto... nothing!  The wooden floor falls away, into
|the black void.
