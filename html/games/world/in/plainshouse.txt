$House
|You are standing in the entryway of a large, brick house.  The floor is
|wooden, and covered with a patterned rug.  There is a doorbell on the
|inside, strangely enough.

$Doorbell
|The doorbell is rather ornate, made of polished brass.
>Ring It>plainshouse_doorbell_ring
>Leave It>plainshouse

:plainshouse_doorbell_ring
$RING!
|The doorbell rings.  It makes a small chime sound.  After a short delay,
|there is a much larger chime sound.  The sound is deafening.  The entire
|building quakes with it.  You hear someone yelling, just before the
|ceiling caves in.  You feel a sharp blow to your head.

|A TV sits in the corner, with two chairs facing it.  In one of the chairs
|sits a man.

:plainshouse_stairway
$Stairway
|The stairway is made of laminated wood, the kind that creaks when
|stepped on.  There is something scratched into the wood on the wall.

$Upstairs
|You go up the stairs.

:plainshouse_up
$Attic
|It's very old up here.  The light from the stairway reveals a layer of
|dust over everything.  The attic is also filled wall to wall with
|mannequins.  They're pretty creepy.
>Mannequin>plainshouse_up_mannequin

:plainshouse_up_mannequin
$Mannequin
|The mannequin is flesh-coloured and has only the slightest hint of a
|face.  It's been posed to appear as though it's walking.
|Eeeeeuuuugggh...  So creepy!
>Push it over>plainshouse_up_mannequin_push
>Leave>plainshouse_up

:plainshouse_up_mannequin_push
$Push!
|You give the mannequin a good hard shove.  It falls over, knocking down
|the next one, which falls too, knocking over the next one,
|which falls, knocking over the next one,
|which falls, knocking over the next one,
|which falls, knocking over the next one,
|which falls, knocking over the next one,
|etc.
>Run Downstairs>plainshouse_stairway
>Wait>plainshouse_up_mannequin_fall

:plainshouse_up_mannequin_fall
$Uhhh...
|You stand there, watching in the dim light, as the mannequins slowly
|knock each other over.  The last one falls, knocking a wooden beam out
|of place.  The ceiling caves in.
