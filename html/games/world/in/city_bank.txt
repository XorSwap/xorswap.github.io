|The only sign of the way you came in is an open doorway, standing in the
|middle of a seemingly infinite flat surface of white marble with swirling,
|deep green veins in it.  The surface is polished to a smooth shine.
|There is also a desk, made of the same marble as everything else, with a
|person sitting behind it.

$Doorway
|The doorway stands alone on the marble plain; through it you can see the
|city, yet behind it is nothing but the smooth marble backside of the door.
