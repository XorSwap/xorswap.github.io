:pillars
$White Towers
|Rectangular, white columns stick out of the ground at odd angles,
|looking a lot like crystals.  Aside for a few gaps here and there, they
|almost completely fill the area.  You seem to be standing in a clearing,
|surrounded by the pillars.  The sky is black here, and you can see that
|the pillars are glowing slightly.  There is no sign of the trapdoor
|that led you here.

$Small Clearing
|You enter a small clearing in the glowing pillars.  There is what
|appears to be a small dynamo sitting in the middle of the clearing.

|The dynamo seems to be broken, and you can't get it to do anything.

:pillars_suit
$Clearing
|In the clearing, there is what appears to be a black-and-white tuxedo
|suit, sitting, empty on a small wooden three-legged stool.  It looks as
|though there could be a person wearing it, except for the fact that it's
|empty.

$Suit
|Upon closer inspection, the suit seems to have been starched enough for
|it to be able to stand up on it's own.

:pillars_suit_touch
$Touch It
|You gently poke the suit with your finger.  The suit falls off of the
|stool with a starchy FWUMP.

:pillars_out
$Tiny Clearing
|This clearing is minuscule!  It's just big enough to house two
|rectangular, white doors made of the same material as everything else
|around here.  The doors open as you approach, leading into a tiny room.

:pillars_out_elevator
$Elevator
|The doors close behind you, and the room starts to rise.  After a short
|delay, during which nothing seems to happen, the doors open.
