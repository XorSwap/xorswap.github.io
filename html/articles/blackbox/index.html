<p><h1><a name="intro">Inside the Black Box</a></h1>
Most people consider a computer to be a black box, they have a mental image of what a computer is, but no idea what is inside it.
They think of the computer as one object, one mental group, rather than the crazy cumulation of the past couple decades of ideas.
My goal with this is very similar to that of The Joy of X<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, in that I would like to start with the very basics of how a computer works, and work up to the level that they are at now.
We'll start with the very basics of boolean logic and work our way up to the operating system level.

<p><h1><a name="intro">Boolean Logic</a></h1>
In the math that you are used to, there are an infinite amount of different numbers to use; they just don't end.
In boolean math, or logic, however, there are exactly <b>two</b> different numbers which correspond to true and false.
These are the infamous 'ones and zeros' that are 'inside' computers.
If you've ever believed anyone telling you about straightening cables so that the ones and zeros don't get stuck, you may want to quit now.
Anyways, instead of the normal mathematical operations + - * /, there are only three boolean operations:
<b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, and <b>not</b>.
These are pretty self explanatory in that they work pretty much exactly the same as in english.
The only notable difference is the <b>or</b> operator.
If someone asks for one thing <b>or</b> another, having both things is not part of what they meant.
We can use what are called 'truth tables' to help clarify the meaning of these operators.
A truth table looks like this:
<p><!-- OR -->
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Left</b></td>
	<td><b>Right</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
This is, in fact, a truth table for the <b>or</b> operator:
<b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> are the left and right operands of the <b>or</b> operator, respectively, and <b>Result</b> is, of course, the result of the operation.
We can define truth tables for all three of the operators as follows:
<p><!-- AND -->
<h3><b>and:</b></h3>
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Left</b></td>
	<td><b>Right</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p><!-- OR -->
<h3><b>or:</b></h3>
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Left</b></td>
	<td><b>Right</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p><!-- NOT -->
<h3><b>not:</b></h3>
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Input</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
Note that the <b>not</b> operator only takes one input.
We can use these operators, along with parenthesis, to create the equivalent of mathematical expressions:
<pre><!-- EXPRESSIONS -->
(false or true) = true
(not true) = false
(not false) = true
((not true) and (false or true)) = false
((not false) and (false or true)) = true
</pre>
In reality, these different operators are implemented as 'logic gates', tiny electronic circuits that behave the same as the different operators, using a powered wire as true, and an unpowered wire as false.
These logic gates can be wired together so as to simulate parenthesis.
</p>
<p><h1><a name="bool2">Advanced Logic Gates</a></h1>
There are, in fact, many more logic gates than just the three I have listed:
the <b>xor</b> gate, which is only true when exactly one of it's inputs is true:
<p><!-- XOR -->
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Left</b></td>
	<td><b>Right</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
and the <b>implies</b> gate, which is only true when exactly one of it's inputs is true and one is false:
<p><!-- IMPLIES -->
<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Left</b></td>
	<td><b>Right</b></td>
	<td><b>Result</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>false</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td>false</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p><h1><a name="bin">Binary</a></h1>
Computers use a somewhat different number system then people do.
When we do math, we use what is called a base-10 number system, because there are 10 different symbols: 0 through 9.
The system computers use is a binary<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup> system, which is where the 'zeros and ones' come from: the two digits in binary, 0 and 1.
OK, so what does this binary system look like?
To understand this we need to go waaay back to how everyone first learns numbers, the place system.
The place system, for those of you who are to far from elementary school goes like this:
<p><!-- PLACE SYSTEM -->
<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<td><b>Amount</b></td>
	<td>10000</td>
	<td>1000</td>
	<td>100</td>
	<td>10</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0.1</td>
	<td>0.01</td>
	<td>0.001</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>Power</b></td>
	<td>10<sup>4</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>3</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>2</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>1</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>0</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>-1</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>-2</sup></td>
	<td>10<sup>-3</sup></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
You can write any number by putting the decimal point between 1 and 0.1, and adding digit1*placevalue1+digit2*placevalue2+digit3*placevalue3... for all the digits.
Binary works on a very similar principle, but using powers of 2:
<p><!-- BINARY SYSTEM -->
<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<td><b>Amount</b></td>
	<td>16</td>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0.5</td>
	<td>0.25</td>
	<td>0.125</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>Power</b></td>
	<td>2<sup>4</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>3</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>2</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>1</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>0</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>-1</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>-2</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>-3</sup></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
To write a number in binary, it's the same as in decimal, but with 0 and 1.
For instance, to write the number five:
<p><!-- BINARY FIVE -->
<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<td><b>Amount</b></td>
	<td>16</td>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>Power</b></td>
	<td>2<sup>4</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>3</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>2</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>1</sup></td>
	<td>2<sup>0</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>Value</b></td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>Digit</b></td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
This is equal to five because there is a 1 in the fours place, and a one in the ones place, and 4+1=5.
