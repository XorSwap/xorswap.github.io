<h1>How Many Menu Options Does Five Guys Have?</h1>
So the other day, I was at a <a href="http://fiveguys.com/" target="_blank">Five Guys</a> restaurant and, nerdy as I am, I got to thinking: how many different, individual things are there to order?<br/>
Well, let's start by looking at the menu:<br/>

We have:
<ul>
	<li>15 different toppings.</li>
	<li>8 different burgers.</li>
	<li>4 different sandwitches</li>
	<li>4 different hot dogs</li>
	<li>2 different types of fries</li>
</ul>
Let's start with the toppings: you can either have a topping, or you can't.  Two choices.  There are also 15 different menu toppings, this means that there are 2<sup>15</sup> different patterns of toppings to put on anything, which is 32768.<br/>
There are 8 different types of burgers to order, and each comes with toppings.  We combine the two to get 8*2<sup>15</sup> different burgers to order, which is 262144.<br/>
Then, all we have to do is add 10, for the 4 sandwitches, 4 hot dogs, and 2 fries.  This leaves us with a grand total of 262154 different menu items.  Not bad for a menu scarcely bigger than my hand!<br/>
