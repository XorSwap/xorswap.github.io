<h1>FRACTRAIN, a FRACTRAN Interpreter</h1>
<a href="ft">Download</a><br/>
FRACTRAN is a language invented by John Conway that I have recently become absolutely facinated with lately.
It is a freakishly simple language that somehow is turing complete.
A FRACTRAN program consists of an ordered set of fractions of natural numbers, and an accumulator.
The accumulator starts out as the input number to the program, and is repeatedly multiplied by the first fraction in the list that yields a natural number.
When no fraction in the list gives a natural number, the program halts with the accumulator as the output.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRACTRAN">This</a> Wikipedia page elaborates more on the subject.<br/>
I wrote this program both as an exercise in Python, and as a way to further explore FRACTRAN.<br/>
It's help page is as follows:
<pre>
usage: ft [-h] [-v] [-f] [-x] [-r file [file ...]] [-e prog] [-p powers]

FRACTRAIN, a FRACTRAN Interpreter.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         print value of accumulator at each step
  -f, --factor          print the prime factors of the accumulator
  -x, --exit            exit program without running the interpreter
  -r file [file ...], --run file [file ...]
                        run program from file(s)
  -e prog, --execute prog
                        execute program from command line
  -p powers, --print powers
                        print powers of number
</pre>
Programs are written as an input, followed by a comma seperated list or fractions in brackets.
For instance, Conway's prime calculating program could be written as <code>2(17/91,78/85,19/51,23/38,29/33,77/29,95/23,77/19,1/17,11/13,13/11,15/14,15/2,55/1)</code>, and run with the following:
<pre>
./ft -fx -p 2 -e '2(17/91,78/85,19/51,23/38,29/33,77/29,95/23,77/19,1/17,11/13,13/11,15/14,15/2,55/1)'
</pre>
It would output something like this:
<pre>
2 (2^1)
4 (2^2)
8 (2^3)
32 (2^5)
128 (2^7)
2048 (2^11)
8192 (2^13)
131072 (2^17)
</pre>
Before you quit on it, because it's too slow.
